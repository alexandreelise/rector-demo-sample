# Rector Demo Sample

### MY STORY (WHY?)
Hi Rector Community!
I'm Alex, a new rector fan learning rector for public and private project.

Here is my story:

Recently I struggled like a worm to make a failing test to reproduce the supposed "bug" but couldn't reproduce it
locally even if a confined reduced set of classes. Rector and ECS beat me flawlessly with a perfect score. I saw the
message in my mind "You lose! PERFECT!" "Game Over" "Insert a coin".

Anyway, joke aside, this experience a creating a reduced set repo helped me grasp the best practices in our industry and
more importantly understand more and more your everyday work answering to random developers questions around the world.
I am so happy to learn rector, and you seem to be such a nice guy not like many developer around there. Thanks for your
help you and your awesome team and for such a cool futuristic tool called rector. I will make a vow to master this tool
to its limits and try to contribute back as much as I can If I am not behind an NDA.

### I WANT TO HELP THE RECTOR COMMUNITY: (WHAT ?)
Step after step (like in rector). Rule after rule, Processor after processor, we will all together find our way to the deep intricacies of the brave new world offered by rector. Feel the pain of refactoring going away more and more and be happy to see a big ball of mud because it can become a cheesecake in one click. That's the true power of automation. The true power of Rector. A thousand thanks to Tomas and his team. 10 Million thanks to you all awesome community. If you can help in any way the rector project, please do. It's a nice feeling to share our knowledge and help others grow as much as you do. That's how I feel. 

### SHARING WANT YOU AND I LEARNED ABOUT RECTOR : (HOW?)
By sharing what I learned about rector, I help other people like you and me sharpen their skills about a great tool that might get you land your dream job who knows? Or your dream clients. Learning new skills always open new possibilities, new doors to unknown, sometimes, at first scary places in our minds, because we feel it's insecure or "impossible" to change this way or another "mind blocker". Don't worry. It's a journey, a walk through life that anyone will face one day or another in one way or another. I am not here to teach you lessons about life. I am not your dad, a psychiatrist nor some kind of guru. Just sharing a thought with you folks.
